# Bargainix. :convenience_store:

Hello! Welcome to this repository.

On this occasion I will present one of my best projects, **Bargainix**, this is an e-commerce, which consumes the data from a REST API created by me, to review this in depth you can follow the following [Bargainix API REST](https://github.com/Alicbm/online-store "Bargainix API REST").

This application has different features, among these we have a main modal, this is for the **Categories**, here you can select only the products you want to see. In the categories there are different products for each category, you can choose a product and see only the product you selected. Bargainix has 6 categories and they are as follows:

- Tecnology.
- Work out.
- Home Features.
- Clothing.
- Tools.
- Toys.

On the other hand, we have 2 more modals, one to filter products, it is possible to filter products by different brands or by price ranges. The price ranges are:

- Products with prices less than $200.
- Products with prices between $200 and $500.
- Products with prices over $500.

The last modal has the function of sort the products, by **Lower Prices**, **Higher Prices**, or the default option **More relevants**.

The modals are important features in the application, but they are not the only options, we can search for products by name, or by the description of each product, even by price, we can do these searches in the input search, it is available in all routes. Another feature of this app is the product description path, here you can review the specific description of the products, you will see a carousel of recommended products for you.

However, the app has more features, a very important option is the shopping cart, you can select products and send these products to the shopping cart route, already in this route, you can add more products, if it is the same product or other products. There is a section that calculates the price of the different products in the shopping cart, and shows you the final price of all the products that you have added to the cart.

Finally, we have two last options, the first, is the possibility of writing comments, there is a section where you can read the comments of other people or read your comment, here you can select the quality of the product, with three different ranges, **Good** (five stars), **Fair** (three stars) or **Poor** (one star). Lastly, you can select any product you like as a favorite.
