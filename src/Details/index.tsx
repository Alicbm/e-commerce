      <p>These products are not real, it is not possible to get these items, since this e-commerce was created with the aim of putting my skills as a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> into practice. However, this app has all the options of a real e-commerce, it has <strong>Related Products</strong>, <strong>Categories</strong>, <strong>Product Recommendations</strong>, <strong>Product Descriptions</strong>, <strong>Cart Purchase Option</strong> and much more.</p>
